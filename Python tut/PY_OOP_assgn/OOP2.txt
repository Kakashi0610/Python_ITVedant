import datetime
from datetime import date
class Employee:
    def __init__ (self,first,last,pay,dob):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + "." + last + "@company.com"
        self.dob = dob
    
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first,self.last)
    
    def age(dob):
        today = date.today()
        dob = dob.dob 
        return today.year - dob.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (dob.month, dob.day))
         
    
emp1 = Employee("aa","ss",122,date(1991,2,3))
emp2 = Employee("ww","ii",637,date(1997,8,24))
emp3 = Employee("ee","oo",986,date(1986,10,19))

#driver code
print(Employee.age(emp2))
